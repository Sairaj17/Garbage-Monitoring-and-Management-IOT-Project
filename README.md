# Garbage-Monitoring-and-Management-IOT-Project

ABSTRACT:-
Many times, in our city we see that the garbage bins or dustbins placed at public places are overloaded. It creates unhygienic conditions for people as well as ugliness to that place leaving bad smell. 
To avoid all such situations we are going to implement a project called IoT Based Smart Garbage Collection system. We are also providing waste management by separating wet trash and dry trash.

INTRODUCTION:- 

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in English: Clean India Mission and abbreviated as SBA or SBM for "Swachh Bharat Mission" is a national campaign by the Government of India, covering 4,041 statutory cities and towns, to clean the streets, roads and infrastructure of the country.
Therefore, we have introduced a new concept using load cell. This is a sensor which intimates about the load place don it. So that the garbage can also be checked in this way. Smart collection bin works in the similar manner with the combination of sensors namely weight sensor and Weight sensor that indicates its weight and different levels respectively. The Weight sensors will show us the various levels of garbage in the dustbins and also the weight sensor gets activated to send its output ahead when its threshold level is crossed. These details are further given to the Arduino Uno (AT mega 328) and the controller gives the details to the Wi-Fi module (ESP 8266).
